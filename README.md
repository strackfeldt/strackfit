# strakfit: The Bad Fitness App

---

## About

Welcome to StrakFit! This app is the product of a few caffeinated nights, one aspiring coder and a hasty decision to write a bad finess app and slap my name on it. The app offers a hodgepodge of features, including a semi-functional timer and some half decent workout suggestions.
